Static Memory Allocation
1. Allocation time - Compile time.
2. Location - Static Memory
3. Lifetime - Entire programm execution or function scope
4. Flexibility - Limited, size fixed at compile time
5. Efficiency - Faster access compare to dynamic Allocation
    int x = 10 // Static Memory Allocation // Static integer variable.

Dynamic Memory Allocation
1. Allocation time - Run time
2. Location - Heap Memory
3. Lifetime - Controlled by programmer using new and delete
4. Flexibility - High, size can be determined at runtime
5. Efficiency - Slower access compared to Static allocation
