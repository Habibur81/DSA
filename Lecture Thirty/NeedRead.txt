1. As the name suggests, C++ preprocessors are tools 
that transform (preprocess) our program before it is compiled.

Preprocessors use preprocessor directives in order to control the 
code transformation. For example, #include <iostream>

Preprocessor Directives
In C++, all preprocessor directives begin with the # symbol. 
For example, #include, #define, #if, and so on.

Macros in C++
Macros are essentially text substitution mechanisms 
handled by the preprocessor before compilation. 
They offer a way to define constant values and 
code snippets that can be reused throughout your program.
